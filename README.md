# Backend

Project Idea: Teams often have communication issues on projects from assignment to completion. Our app Work Well, will take the mystery out of the project updates and errors that team members run into or when they have added to a project.

Project Details: 

The backend team put their CRUD skills to the test to make sure that routes were in working order and that nothing was missed along the way. 
Back-end coding holds the routes, models, and controllers it the backbone that holds this project together. 


Models:
The two main models will be progress.js and user.js.
- progress.js 

Controllers
Similarly, the two main controllers will be 'progress' and 'user'

    Progress will have CRUD methods to:
    -Create tasks that need to be completed
    -Read (show) each task that needs to be done
    -Update a list of tasks with a new task
    -Read if a task is completed or not
    -Update if a tasks is completed or not
    -Delete option when a task that is completed
